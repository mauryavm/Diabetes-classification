**Diabetes Classification Project**

Overview :

This project is focused on developing a model to classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic using a variety of machine learning algorithms on relevant features. 
I have implemented the project in Python, utilizing powerful libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn to perform data analysis, manipulation, and visualization.

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build an accurate classification model that can effectively distinguish between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals.

The project involves the following key tasks:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted a thorough examination of the dataset to identify patterns, correlations, and insights that inform the model-building process.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the data by handling missing values, normalizing features, and encoding categorical variables.

Feature Engineering: Created new features and selected the most relevant ones to improve model performance.

Data Splitting: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

Model Development: Implemented machine learning algorithms including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree to build the classification model.

Model Evaluation: Achieved a classification accuracy of 77%, identifying the best-performing model for the dataset.

Tools and Technologies :

Programming Language: Python

Libraries:

Pandas: For data analysis.

NumPy: For data manipulation.

Matplotlib & Seaborn: For data visualization.

Scikit-learn: For implementing machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Tree.

Results :

The final model achieved a good classification accuracy,  effectively distinguishing between diabetic and non-diabetic individuals with high accuracy.

Conclusion : 

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques to a real-world healthcare problem. The developed model can potentially aid in early diagnosis and treatment planning for diabetes.
